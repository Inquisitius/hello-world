# hello-world
Repo I made for a lab in a CS Class

Rylee, Titus
This program first asks the user to enter their name and a number they'd like to multiply by the power of two. After the two requests are completed the program will output, in a nice message, the entered name with the squared number the user chose.

I chose the MIT License because it was open-source and considering the nature of this project it did not need any kind of stringent copyright protections. If this was a more serious project, I might have considered using a stricter license.
